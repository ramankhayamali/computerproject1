            from the capital city, Kathmandu. It is located in and serves as the
            headquarters of Bhaktapur District in Bagmati Province of Nepal.In

            The history of Bhaktapur is intwined with the history of Kathmandu
            Valley itself and as such it's early history is filled with
            mythology. As per a folklore, the entire Kathmandu Valley was once a
            lake which was drained by the Bodhisattva Manjushri making human
            habitation in the valley possible. The Kiranta are among the first
            people group to inhabit the fertile valley. The eastern part of the
            valley was particularly popular for the production of rice and was
            called as Khopring (meaning "rice village") by the Kiranti people.
